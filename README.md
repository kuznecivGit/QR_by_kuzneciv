Hello everyone! This is my humble C# application for scanning QR codes.  
When you launch the application, you see a banner with a project description and useful links.
At the bottom, there are different segments:

Segment 1

A button for uploading an image in popular formats (such as .png and .jpg).
A button for scanning a QR code. If a QR code is found, it will be decoded and displayed in a separate window. Otherwise, an error message will appear.
Segment 2

This is where the decoded text will be displayed.
It can be copied, but not edited.
Segment 3

A button to switch between the blue and gray themes of the application.
A button to enable button sounds.
