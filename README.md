Hello everyone! This is my humble C# application for scanning QR codes.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use?
When you launch the application, you see a banner with a project description and useful links.
At the bottom, there are different segments:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Segment 1

A button for uploading an image in popular formats (such as .png and .jpg).
A button for scanning a QR code. If a QR code is found, it will be decoded and displayed in a separate window. Otherwise, an error message will appear.

Segment 2

This is where the decoded text will be displayed.
It can be copied, but not edited.

Segment 3

A button to switch between the blue and gray themes of the application.
A button to enable button sounds.

P. S. In the root of the project, there are files "MainForm.cs" and "QR_by kuzneciv.exe." 
They do not work and need to be opened from their "originals" located inside the project folders. 
The folders in the root are created only for convenient demonstration.
